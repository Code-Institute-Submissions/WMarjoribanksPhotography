## Design 

### Colour Scheme
The colour theme chosen to style the included content was generated by Coolors. The colour palette began with a deep red used for text content,
a lighter shade for the navigation bar for the two elements to contrast, and a vibrant blue colour, which notified the user that a button was 
being hovered.

### Typography
Throughout the site, a constant theme used was by using Lobster Two and Nanum Gothic fonts, from Google Fonts. Lobster Two was
used against headings and input forms including buttons, and Nanum Gothic as the primary font for navigation links and text content
not included in any heading elements. Sans Serif was used as a substitute where the aforementioned custom fonts were not supported by
selected browsers or devices.
### Imagery
With imagery being at the forefront and of utmost importance to the site, original artworks owned by William Marjoribanks, was used throughout
the website to display high quality images, and the result they could expect from purchasing a piece from the portfolio.
