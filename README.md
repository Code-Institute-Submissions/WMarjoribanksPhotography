### Colour Scheme
The colour theme chosen to style the included content was generated by Coolors. The colour palette began with a Pewter blue, for the navigation bar
and footer. a contrasting green was used for cursor hovering and buttons, with a custom black and contrasting cream colour used throughout for text input,
and content.

### Typography
Throughout the site, a constant theme used was by using Italiana, Nanum Gothic and Almaira, from Google Fonts. Italiana was
used against headings and input forms including buttons, and Nanum Gothic as the primary font for navigation links and text content
not included in any heading elements. Almaira was used against the heading and content elements in the Modal Window to match that of the
third party site where images can be purchased. Sans Serif was used as a substitute where the aforementioned custom fonts were not supported 
by selected browsers or devices.

### Imagery
With imagery being at the forefront and of utmost importance to the site, original artworks owned by William Marjoribanks, were used throughout
the website to display high quality images, and the result they could expect from purchasing a piece from the portfolio.

## Further Testing

# Known Bugs

On deployment of the W. Marjoribanks Photography website, it was identified that the images weren't displaying on any of the carousel
elements, gallery grid system and modal windows. This was fixed by reuploading the images  without the '_' filename prefix and changing 
the file extension from '.jpg' to '.JPG'. This rectified the issue and now, when a user accesses the GitHub pages link at the head of
the README.md document, all images are displayed.
