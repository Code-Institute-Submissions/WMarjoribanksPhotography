## Design 

### Colour Scheme
The colour theme chosen to style the included content was generated by Coolors. The colour palette began with a Pewter blue, for the navigation bar
and footer. a contrasting green was used for cursor hovering and buttons, with a custom black and contrasting cream colour used throughout for text input,
and content.

### Typography
Throughout the site, a constant theme used was by using Italiana, Nanum Gothic and Almaira, from Google Fonts. Italiana was
used primarily against larger headings and subheadings. Nanum Gothic was used as the primary font for buttons and text content
not included in any heading elements. Almaira was used against the heading and content elements in the Modal Window to match that of the
third party site where images can be purchased. Sans Serif was used as a substitute where the aforementioned custom fonts were not supported 
by selected browsers or devices.

### Imagery
With imagery being at the forefront and of utmost importance to the site, original artworks owned by William Marjoribanks, were used throughout
the website to display high quality images, and the result they could expect from purchasing a piece from the portfolio.

### Wireframes
The wireframes created at the beginning of the project and used as a reference throughout are
situated in a dedicated folder entitled ['wireframes'](https://github.com/LHBank/WMarjoribanksPhotography/tree/master/wireframes), 
at the same level as the homepage, 'index.html'. It contains screenshot images, for both the Desktop and Tablet viewport screen sizes. As mentioned, the 
wireframes were used as a point of reference, but on project development, found that there were various, more suitable elements to display the portfolio.

# Testing

## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

### First Time Visitor Goals
* As a first time user, I was able to see that the site was dedicated to a photographer or travel enthusiast.
* As a first time user, I was able to navigate with ease throughout the site using the navbar at the head of page, to each
dedicated section and had options which linked to third party sites.
* As a first time user, I had various ways of signing up to site updates via: the "Contact" page in the navigation bar and
the "Register Here" button on the homepage landing card.
* As a first time user, after visiting all dedicated pages throughout the sites, the option to connect through social media/networks
was made available consistently in the footer of the page, via dedicated logos which I recognised immediately.
### Returning Visitor Goals
* As a returning user of the site, I was able to contact the author of this page using the "Contact" page form, regarding a tour
I was interested in taking with my family, and who would take payment.
* As a returning visitor, I was able to find out if initially unavailable images which I had selected on my previous visit were now
able to be printed, by clicking on the selected artwork. I was also linked to the "Contact" page by clicking the "More Info" button
on the pop-up window of a selected artwork.
### Frequent User Goals
* As a frequent user of the site, after registering for updates on submitting my details via the "Contact" page, I was able to navigate
with ease to the blog section of the site, to read the newest blog article. I was also able to access this via the homepage, from
the advertised article at the bottom left of the page.

## Further Testing

### Known Bugs

On deployment of the W. Marjoribanks Photography website, it was identified that the images weren't displaying on any of the carousel
elements, gallery grid system and modal windows. This was fixed by reuploading the images  without the '_' filename prefix and changing 
the file extension from '.jpg' to '.JPG'. This rectified the issue and now, when a user accesses the GitHub pages link at the head of
the README.md document, all images are displayed.

### Scalability

In future advancements of the W. Marjoribanks Photography, the aim would be to add a payment feature within the site, as opposed to using
a third party site. In addition to this, it would be ideal to create a search bar, in which frequent users of the site could search for their
chosen artwork or blog article.

### Speed Testing

Due to the site being photography-centric, it requires the use of high-quality images throughout, and despite the efforts made to lessen and 
compress the file size of each img file used, this did have an overall effect on the site's speed. It didn't cause a major issue with loading,
however, it is to be expected.

To measure the speed of the site's loading, I used GTMetrix. [Clicking on this link](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/lhbank.github.io/9Pk3GSXt), 
will open a new window with the report attached to W. Marjoribanks Photography.

# Credits

## Code

* **Hover** effect on 'Choose Art' button on homepage, found at: https://www.developerdrive.com/8-simple-css-hover-effects/

## Content
On inspection of the html files associated with W. Marjoribanks Photography, it is evident 'nofile.html' was not <em>immediately</em>
shown as a navigation link on the navbar, nor through various navigation buttons. This served <em>only</em> as a page which users
would see when clicking on three images which hadn't yet been made available through the third party site for purchase. It provides
the user with a page explaining that the image they were interested in the purchase of, was not yet made available. There was also
a button which linked to the Contact form to reach out for further information or updates.

## Media

[Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) - This tool had been utilised to demonstrate the responsiveness that can
be expected across various screen devices.
