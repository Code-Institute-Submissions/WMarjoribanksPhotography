            <div class="col-12 text-center">
                <h6 class="BlogDate">1/7/2020</h6>
                <h2 class="BlogHead">Don't Go To Bali for Downtime</h2>
                <p class="BlogText text-justify">First impressions of Bali was that the airport taxi driver took the scenic route! I’ve been here all of thirty minutes, 
                and it’s charged me double what it should to get from the airport to my hostel. Granted, it was a forty-minute journey and if I had made the same trip in 
                Scotland, I’d have forked out enough to pay the taxi driver for a day. However, I had the wrong mindset arriving in Bali, thinking it would compare to 
                various other countries I’ve visited in Asia. It would’ve been cheaper had I used one of three “Ubers" to choose from. Grab became my go-to, due to personal 
                reasons against using the preceding international taxi-app service. </p>
                <p class="BlogText text-justify">The following day, I awoke fresh and not even slightly bleary-eyed. This was due to being the sole occupant of my hostel 
                dormitory. I grabbed a Grab, to Bali’s renowned Hindu water temple, Tanah Lot. From my hostel, in the middle of the countryside – away from the Asian 
                equivalent of Majorca, Kuta – it was $2.50 for a 40minute journey. I had to tip the driver, because regardless of whether that’s just ‘how it is’ in Bali, 
                that price is too low. Having been a taxi driver in a past life, I felt obliged to do the right thing.</p>
                <p class="BlogText text-justify">The architecture of Tanah Lot was magnificent and rivalled one of the smaller tombs of Angkor Wat. That’s what I wish 
                I could say, only most of the temple complex was under construction. It was decorated with mounds of litter. Whilst finally, being under siege by hordes 
                of tourists.</p>
                <p class="BlogText text-justify">So, this is where the crux of the article begins. Bali – being home to a largely Hindu population, in my eyes wholly 
                spiritual – was in stark contrast, the polar opposite. Having worked ten arduous months in hospitality prior to my arrival, to fund this 'vacation' – 
                I felt less stressed, when the hotel I worked for was told, the water supply had been cut due to sudden snowfall breaking the mains pipe and generator.</p>
                <p class="BlogText text-justify">The island is so unbelievably westernised, and it costs less for an Australian to travel to Bali, than it does domestically. 
                Between human and vehicular traffic, I couldn’t wait to leave. It wasn’t until I departed the main island of Bali, and sailed to Nusa Lembongan (of course, 
                I didn’t sail, it was a very very fast boat ferrying many many people) that the calm washed over me. Those films where the stressed-out rat-race survivor, 
                post-breakup, jump from the boat onto the shore of an island – I was <em>that</em> person in <em>that</em> scene. </p>
                <p class="BlogText text-justify">The roads were only freshly laid. There were motorcycles, but few cars. When I arrived at my next accommodation, Maclir, 
                the owner, who wasn’t much older than me, was proud of this island. His home. But not in an arrogant way. Just in a, ‘you’re here, now enjoy it’ way. I didn’t want to leave. </p>
                <p class="BlogText text-justify">If you can take anything away from this and my additional articles, it might be that I have high expectations. 
                But I believe hard work should be rewarded, for anybody. So, don’t go to Bali. Fly in, and then sail away, to where everybody knows your name. (Cue the music to Cheers).</p>
